# Cosmos Backend

This is a backend that will cache frequent request for our different tools.
- Database to cache request
- Tool to make snapshots on different nodes

## Disclaimer

This project leans extremely heavily on the [CosmJS project](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and other fantastic codebases like [Restake.app](https://github.com/eco-stake/restake) and [Cosmos.directory](https://cosmos.directory) built by the fantastic Tom from [Eco Stake](https://www.ecostake.com/). 
Any contributions, suggestions and ideas from the community are extremely welcome.

## Stake Frites (ü•© , üçü)

Stake Frites is an active validator, but we want to reduce pains and provide useful tools for the community. We built Trackmos to make it easy for all cosmonauts to easily access all their balances. [Delegate with us](https://stakefrites.co) to support more projects like this.
