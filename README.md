## Disclaimer

The initial version of Trakmos was built quickly. 
I'm personally not a Vue or Javascript developer, and this project leans extremely heavily on the [CosmJS project](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and other fantastic codebases like [Keplr Wallet](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet), [Osmosis Zone frontend](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis-frontend) and [ Restake.app](https://github.com/eco-stake/restake). 
It functions very well and any attack surface is very limited however. 
Any contributions, suggestions and ideas from the community are extremely welcome.
